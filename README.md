## Intro

My DIY Arduino-Powered RGB Smart Keyboard as seen at [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UjEVFXl_sq0](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UjEVFXl_sq0)

My implementation of the code is targeted at OBS control, but you can of course change it, and I have included other
example Arduino sketches too.

REST OF THE CODE ETC COMING SOON
Just have to fork the 3D print to fit my non-standard Pro Micro, and find where I lost the sample code
